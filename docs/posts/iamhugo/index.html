  <p>When one is stuck at home due to the Covid&rsquo;s and busy chasing two 9 year olds around and yet needs to stay up to date on technologies and show that one is employable, maybe they should create some things for people to look at.</p>
<p>So let me take a step back. At some point, I realized my previous life in sales just wasn&rsquo;t working out. There were many things that I felt that I did well, but apparently I wasn&rsquo;t always good at my TPS and it could get boring. Because I never made the top dollars, there wasn&rsquo;t enough incentive to stick around. I decided the shortest point between there and happiness was to go back to school and learn some computer stuffs.</p>
<p>I am giving away my age by saying the only computer I owned as a child was a Commodore Vic-20 that I &ldquo;shared&rdquo; with my brother. I assume most people will know what the 20 stands for. If you do not, it doesn&rsquo;t stand for any of the following:
*** TB
*** GB
*** MB</p>
<p>It stands for kilobytes and we loved it. You didn&rsquo;t even need a monitor. You just needed a philips screwdriver and any TV and away you went. I believe an external disc drive was available for the Vic-20, but that was just too fancy for us, so we had a tape drive. And when I say tape drive, I mean it used standard &ldquo;Is it live or is it Memorex&rdquo; cassette tapes.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>I am not Bill Gates. I didn&rsquo;t catch the bug. I got kind of bored with it. There were no clubs and &ldquo;coding&rdquo;:</p>
<pre><code>10 PRINT &quot;Your name goes Here&quot;
20 goto 10
</code></pre><p>was only funny for so long. I got the magazines and tried typing out the programs in the back, but it just didn&rsquo;t take for me at the time.</p>
<p>So fast forward awhile and it is time for a life crisis an a career change and what do I do? I had many years of experience in sales and a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Psychology and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Computers! That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>to be continued&hellip;</p>
